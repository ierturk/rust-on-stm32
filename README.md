# Blinky example in Rust Embassy Async RTOS on the STM32F429-Discovery board with probe-rs on VSCode

[Associated post](https://erturk.me/projects/working-with-rust-embedded-on-wsl/)

Small project by using Ebassy Async RTOS

If everything is installed properly, the workspace can be opened in VS Code and a hit on F5 should build the project without errors or warnings and automatically start a debug session. The program should be halted at the breakpoint at main().

In this post, it’ll be tried to explain how to get a working example by using only the tools that provided by Rust community. So let’s start!
___
### The Tools that Used within this Post
- Rust Toolchain[^1]
- usbpid-win[^2]
- probe-rs[^3]
- VSCode[^4]
- WSL[^5]
- rust-analyzer plugin for VSCode[^6]
- probe-rs plugin for VSCode[^7]
- WSL plugin for VSCode[^8]
- GitHUB repository[^9]
- STM32F429ZI Discovery Board[^10]
- Embassy OS[^11]

___
### Setup
- Install WSL[^12] and an Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS[^13] instance from Windows Store
- Download and install usbpid-win from the Github repository[^2]
- Run the WSL instance on a windows commandline as follow
```
PS C:\Users\ierturk> wsl ~
```
- Install probe-rs within WSL instance as decribed in here[^3]
- Plugin the Discovery board into a USB port on your Windows PC   
On a windows command line when you issued follwing commad,  a list will be displayed
```
PS C:\Users\ierturk> usbipd wsl list
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE                                                        STATE
3-1    0483:374b  ST-Link Debug, USB Mass Storage Device, STMicroelectronic...  Not attached
3-2    046d:c52b  Logitech USB Input Device, USB Input Device                   Not attached
4-1    05ac:8509  FaceTime HD Camera (Built-in), FaceTime HD camera             Not attached
6-2    05ac:8242  Apple IR Receiver                                             Not attached
6-3    05ac:0253  Apple Keyboard, Apple Multi-Touch, USB Input Device           Not attached
7-3    05ac:821d  Apple Broadcom Built-in Bluetooth                             Not attached
```
- Bind the USB device on an elevated command line as follow   
```
PS C:\Users\root> usbipd bind --busid 3-1
```
- Now you can attach the USB device as standard user as follow   
```
PS C:\Users\ierturk> usbipd wsl attach --busid 3-1
```
- Install VSCode and the plugins mentioned here [^6] [^7] [^8]

___
### Running and Debugging
- Open VSCode
- Install WSL plugin[^8] in VSCode
- Connect to WSL instance from within VSCode using WSL plugin[^8]
- Install rust-analyzer[^6] and probe-rs[^7] plugins in VSCode in WSL instance
- Open terminal in VSCode
- Create a work directory and clone the repository[^9] as follow
```
ierturk@DESKTOP-JC8L4M1:~$ mkdir Work
ierturk@DESKTOP-JC8L4M1:~$ cd Work
ierturk@DESKTOP-JC8L4M1:~$ sudo apt-get install git
ierturk@DESKTOP-JC8L4M1:~$ git clone https://github.com/ierturk/rust-embedded-wsl-probe-rs.git
```
- Open folder `rust-embedded-wsl-probe-rs`
- Now just open debug tab and hit the button
- Place breakpoints where you want
- Hit the play button

Then it should be displayed following screen
